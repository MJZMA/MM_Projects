# Michael's Quantitative Finance Adventure 🚀
Welcome to the wacky world of Michael's Quantitative Finance Projects! 🎢 Here, spreadsheets come to life, code writes itself (we wish!), and quant dreams become a reality. Buckle up and join Michael on this thrilling ride of numbers, models, and just a sprinkle of chaos!

## About Michael
Michael is a finance wizard who decided that mere mortals shouldn't have all the fun. After trading through the pandemic, mastering Excel like a boss, and diving deep into the dark arts of Python, he's now tackling the beast known as Quantitative Finance. 🧙‍♂️📊

## Projects Overview
More info on the way.

Will complete before Eglinton LRT.

## Fun Facts
Michael once reduced processing time from 16 minutes to 5 minutes with VBA. That's 11 more minutes for coffee breaks! ☕

He's also known to sing any song after just listening to it twice. Quant by day, karaoke king by night. 🎤
